        The Goodlark Educational Foundation will celebrate its 30th year in 2018! Itâ€™s been an exciting ride since we
        were formed in 1988 with proceeds from Goodlark Hospital. Our mission, then and now, has been to help promote
        education in Dickson, Hickman and Humphreys Counties, as that was the area the hospital served. For the 2017-18
        school year, the foundation has so far funded forty college, technical and graduate school scholarships
        (totaling $69,000), the Jackson Medical Scholarship ($10,000), the Mills Medical Scholarship ($10,000),
        Valedictorian Scholarships ($6,000), and two Deason Healthcare Scholarships ($5,000 each). We sponsored our
        12th annual essay contest for high school juniors with scholarship prizes of $3,500. Over the years, we have
        also supported many educational programs in the community and individual projects at area schools.
